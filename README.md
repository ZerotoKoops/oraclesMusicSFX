This is merely a repository of the games' channel data seperated into individual files for easier viewing.

Structure
-----
There are two folders in the root:

 1. oracleMUS/
 2. oracleSFX/

Inside, there should each be three folders.

 1. Ages/
 2. Common/
 3. Seasons/
 
Each of the folders has a number of S files, labeled according to [Drenn's music constants](https://github.com/Drenn1/oracles-disasm/blob/hack-base/constants/music.s "Drenn's music constants").
Refer to this file or the EXCEL file if you wish to correspond the numerical value of the sound with the name.

If you are comfortable with its use, there is an EXCEL file that houses certain data about each sound as well as hyperlinks to each file.
(Caution: there will be a warning when attempting to open the files. Read carefully and proceed.)
